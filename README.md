# news-map

This project aims to visualize news articles on a world map. 

Currently, the project is scraping data from the New York Times, however I hope to expand this by making use of the [News API](https://newsapi.org). 
I am sticking with the New York Times because of their great geotagging in their articles, and will use that data as a proof of concept for the main features of this project before I get more creative in geolocation articles from the News API.

To do:
- [x] Prettier map
- [ ] Linking to articles
- [ ] Language processor to categorize article into economy, environment, politic
- [ ] Figure out how to geotag News API articles
